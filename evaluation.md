### Project Feedback + Evaluation

Your instructors will be grading you using this rubric.

For each criterion below, instructors will give you a score according to the following guidelines. "Ticking" all of the boxes for a criterion will earn a "meets expectations".

They will also assign a **Total Score**, to serve as an overall gauge of whether you met the project goals. However, __the more important scores are the individual ones__, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

| Score | Expectations |
| :---- | :----------- |
| **0** | _Does not meet expectations_ |
| **1** | _Meets expectactions_ |
| **2** | _Exceeds expectations_ |

## Project Workflow
##### How effectively did you plan, execute, and present this project?
- The `readme.md` file contains any necessary installation instructions
- The `planning` folder contains:
  - a picture / screenshot of your ERD (up to date!)
  - a `wireframes` directory, which in turn contains at least 2 drawings or photos of wireframes and ERDs
  - a `user_stories.md` file, which in turn contains at least 7 user stories (or a link to a Trello board or equivalent)
- A Github issue was submitted to the `project2` repository **by 11:00am on Friday, November 20th,** containing a link to a hosted video
- The video itself and/or the site on which it can be found contains a website or e-mail address through which the creator can be contacted
- The video is at least 3 minutes long, but **no more than** 5 minutes
- The video contains:
  - A description and demo of the app
  - A code sample explaining one thing of which the creator is proud
  - One thing the creator would do differently next time
  - The next feature the creator would like to implement

## Technical Requirements
##### How well does your app demonstrate a grasp of the technologies introduced in class?
- The app contains at least 2 models
- The app contains at least 1 association
- At least 1 model incorporates `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` routes

## Creativity / Interface
##### How memorable and enjoyable to use is your app?
- The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS
- The app delivers something of value to the end user: it is not just a login button and an index page

## Code Quality
##### How able would an uninformed programmer be to reuse and extend your code?
- The code follows style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, indenting, modularity, and semantic naming
- The code is commented only with what is necessary to document what is happening in the code
- For any page, copying its source code as it appears in the **browser** and pasting it into the [W3 Validator](http://validator.w3.org) yields 0 errors

## Deployment and Functionality
##### How accessible is your app to those who may want to explore it?
- Cursory use of the app by an uninformed user yields no errors that "break" it
- The app is deployed to Heroku (or another hosting service)
- The contents of the creator's Github repository is identical to that of the Heroku repository
- The `URL` field of the Github repository contains a link to the deployed version of the app
