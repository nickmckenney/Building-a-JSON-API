# Presentations

In place of doing science-fair-style or one-by-one presentations, you will prepare a short (3 -5 minute) screencast demo of your project, which you will upload to YouTube/Vimeo. We'll watch the presentations on Friday afternoon!

### Hard Requirements

Your video must be uploaded to YouTube, Vimeo, or a similar service. **Please do not e-mail us your video or put it in a Github repository** since it will probably be at least 500MB.

**Your video must include...**

- ...a website or e-mail address through which you can be contacted. This can be included either in the video itself or as the video description (the text beneath YouTube videos).
- ...a description and demo of your app
- ...a code sample explaining one thing you're proud of
- ...one thing you would do differently next time
- ...the next feature you would like to implement

### Submission deadline: Friday, November 20<sup>th</sup>, 11:00am

"But instructors, I won't be done with my project by then!"

a) That's OK, the people viewing your video don't have to know that. Show off what does work!
b) Go to sleep!

### Recording a video

You may use any video-recording mechanism you wish. QuickTime Player is in the Applications folder of your Mac. Notice that if you go to the "File" menu you can create a "New Screen Recording"! This collects audio as well; it's how instructors screencast lessons. You can then save your video to your computer and upload it to YouTube.

If you're feeling really fancy you can use iMovie -- also in your Applications folder -- to swankify your video. However, this should be a priority far below actually completing your project. Having a snazzy-looking video isn't on the rubric!

Alternatively, you can also create a video using YouTube's own built-in recorder, which makes it easy to add basic effects, background music, and text to your videos.

If you have a Gmail account, you already have a YouTube account. Just go to https://www.youtube.com/dashboard

### How to submit

Include a link to your video as an issue on **this** repository.
